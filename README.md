# Pokémon Red and Blue - Custom Starter ROM

This is a **non-PSR-official, modified** version of the disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue.
Modifications are made to offer starter customization for the player, as well as workarounds for RNG manipulations.

It builds the following ROMs:

- Pokemon Red pokered.gbc `sha1: 5156dca039f7d3c65fa8df20b7842a2bbfe07214` `crc32: 0040D1B9`
- Pokemon Blue pokeblue.gbc `sha1: 72c9e21ddf4700c1e0691b31b82fd4e126315b21` `crc32: 0CE64F80`
- pokeblue_debug.gbc (debug build) `sha1: d3a1eed419251e9b184dc9db0146b005b71cfaac`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

If you only need to apply the changes to an existing vanilla ROM, see [**PATCHES.md**](PATCHES.md)
